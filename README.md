# SpeechGPT
A personal assistant built on ChatGPT

## How It Works 
The program will listen to voices from the microphone and transcribe them to text. Once it has done that, it will check if the word "Matt" is in the transcription (a name to get its attention) and if it is, it will send the transcription to ChatGPT. Once it receives a response, it will use a text to speech function to create a sound file with the response and play it back.

## Files
+ Main.py: The only file in this repository, which contain the program. NOTE: Remember to put in your OpenAI API key.

## Changing the name
If you want to change the name used to get the program's attention ("Matt" by default), change all references tot the word "Matt" to whatever word you want to use the wake up the program.
